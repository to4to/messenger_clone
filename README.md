# Messenger Clone
This repository contains a full-fledged messenger clone built using Next.js 13, React, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, MongoDB, NextAuth, and Pusher. The goal of this project is to provide a scalable and feature-rich messaging application that resembles popular messaging platforms.

## Features

- Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly, thanks to the real-time capabilities provided by Pusher.
- User authentication: NextAuth is used for user authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely.
- Persistent storage: Messages and user data are stored in a MongoDB database using Prisma, ensuring data integrity and easy retrieval.
- Responsive design: The application is built with a mobile-first approach and is fully responsive across various screen sizes.
- Modern UI: The UI is designed using Tailwind CSS, providing a sleek and visually appealing user experience.
